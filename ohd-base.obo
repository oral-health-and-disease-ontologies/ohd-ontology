remark: Status of this document: This is a work in progress and we do not yet make any promises about the stability of URIs. A known issue is that the upper level of this ontology is an exploratory version of BFO developed in the interim between when BFO 1 was current and before BFO 2 development started. The representation of the CDT codes is tentative - we are discussing this with the ADA. The integration between OBI and OGMS is not complete - we add some axioms here in order to use both in a consistent way. The version of the subject of the FMA used here is an automatic translation of a portion of the entities and relations present in the original FMA. Work is ongoing on improving this subset and using an up-to-date version of the FMA as its basis.
